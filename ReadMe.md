# Swifty Measurement
### Intention
The Swift Programming Language is a modern, clean and amazing tool to create extraordinary apps and algorithms. It is a part of bigger Apple Developer ecosystem where every person could create something awesome with ease!

However, conscious code design requires more knowledge than basic understanding of individual keywords. Discovering how something works under the hood is very often crucial in assimilating the paradigms of a given language.

The Swifty Measurement project is the answer to the question - What is the most efficient way to use Swift?



## Measurements
Please find a list of every measurement cases below.

**Higher Order Functions**
- [Map](Source/Map/ReadMe.md)
- [Flat Map](Source/FlatMap/ReadMe.md)
- [Compact Map](Source/CompactMap/ReadMe.md)
- [Compare Map Types](Source/CompareMaps/ReadMe.md)
- [For Loop](Source/For/ReadMe.md)

**Type Definitions**
- [Unwrapping Optionals](Source/Optionals/ReadMe.md)

**Object types**
- [Struct and Class](Source/StructAndClass/ReadMe.md)

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute into this project. It is the first release, so I would like to improve this repository but do not hesitate to propose some new content!

## Intention
The idea came after inspiration gained by [@twannl](https://x.com/twannl "@twannl")'s post about simplifying algorithms and [galijot_](https://x.com/galijot_ "galijot_")'s comment. I wrote then a short code to measure the execution time of the Swift code blocks. The goal was simple. I would like to know if the Higher Order Function `map(_:)` is more effective with key path or closure parameter.
